# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

###Description of Project
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. During the project I became more comfortable using python and the terminal, as well as more comfortable using github. 

###Usage and Structure
Milestone 5 contains the basis of the game, with a class established and a function with which a game is played. The other milestones show my progress throughout the project.
